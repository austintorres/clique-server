## Planning Story

As a gamer, playing solo can be boring at times. **CliQue** allows online gamers to meet and connect with other online users who are trying to play the same video game as a team/squad. This allows online users to have a live 'Online/Offline' status, 'Current Video Game' being played feature, and able to post, edit, and delete a message.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to be able to change my password
- As a user I want to be able to sign out
- As a user I want to be able to switch my status between online and offline
- As a user I want to create many game requests
- As a user I want to edit or delete game requests
- (Version 1) As a user I want to be able to see my own game requests.

### Technologies Used (Back End)

- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Node.JS
